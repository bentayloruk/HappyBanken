IMMO (in my Mum's opinion) the Handelsbanken online banking usability leaves a little to be desired.  This Chrome extension adds bits and bobs that make it nicer for my Mum.

## Implemented

* Automatically select your bank account in the list, if there is only one account.  BACS and Payment pages.
* Automatically select your bank account in the list, if there is only one account.  BACS and Payment history pages.

## TODO

* Better BACS/Payment template search (or dialogue).
